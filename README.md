My mindustry notes.

## High APM

In many RTS games, higher Actions-per-Minute rates increase your chance of
winning.

Not in Mindustry:

 * Press space to pause the game
 * Now you can luisurely prepare and plan what you want to build: the
   build tab still works.

## Beginner build order

 * The basic rule: Follow the factories starting from the top-left and going right 
 * If a resource is needed, you do not mine yet, mine that one 

The resource you want to have more of is coal. Use water or oil to arrive 
at producing this.

## Separating lines is a good idea

Separating is a good idea for multiple reasons:

 * If you have mined 9k of that resource, your Core will not accept it anymore
   and the flow of resources will halt. If you've put all your resources on
   one big conveyor belt, the complete flow will stop
 * You can branch off from any flow to deliver those resources elsewhere,
   without clogging the conveyor belts

## Maintain an efficient flow of resources

If you are mining more of a resource then fits on one conveyor belt line, add
a second conveyor belt line. In the late game, use a faster conveyor belt
from the point where two inflows converge towards the final stretch towards
to Core.

If a factory has two inputs, and one input is clogged up, increase inflow of
the other product.

## Understand the special conveyor blocks

 * The junction is essential in keeping lines seperate
 * The sorter is great at unclogging a line: make it sort on the undesired
   product, let a conveyor belt with that product branch of. In the end,
   remove that conveyor belt
 * The distributor allows to keep a flow even when one line is clogged up.
   This is unlike a splitter that stops when one line is clogged up

## Mining efficieny does not increase with more conveyor belts

Connecting a drill to one or multiple squares of conveyor belt: it will
always produce the same amount of resources.

## Mech factories are only useful in Core battles

You may expect your mechs to go to the landing zone, but they do not. 

## How to beat Core battles

Most important distinction between you and the computer opponent: the
AI does not (re)build structures: each time you destroy something, it is
lost forever.

 * At the start of the level, directly go towards the enemy core: all its
   cannons need to load up first. During that timespan, destroy conveyor 
   belts: one square is enough to stop the flow of resources forever
 * Save up your mechs: a line of multiple solo mechs is just cannon
   fodder. Instead, make a mech factory produce its maximum amount of 
   units (it will not use up resources at that point). Make a wall between
   you and the enemy somewhere: the mechs will gather there. Open up the
   wall to unleash them all at once
 * Team up with your mechs to carve out a path: build copper walls to protect
   them and yourself. 
 * You can take out a Duo from far range
 * You cannot take out a Scatter without building walls of copper between you
   and the cannon
 * Your ground mechs can take out a Scatter without danger
 * Be aware: cannons need ammo, so after after cutting supply, it will become
   harmless. Do not waste time on these cannons anymore: your mechs may
   shoot at these while passing by
