# mindustry

My mindustry notes.

## High APM

In many RTS games, higher Actions-per-Minute rates increase your chance of
winning.

Not in Mindustry:

 * Press space to pause the game
 * Now you can luisurely prepare and plan what you want to build: the
   build tab still works.

## Beginner build order

 * The basic rule: Follow the factories starting from the top-left and going right 
 * If a resource is needed, you do not mine yet, mine that one 

## Separating lines is a good idea

Separating is a good idea for multiple reasons:

 * If you have mined 9k of that resource, your Core will not accept it anymore
   and the flow of resources will halt. If you've put all your resources on
   one big conveyor belt, the complete flow will stop
 * You can branch off from any flow to deliver those resources elsewhere,
   without clogging the conveyor belts

## Mining efficieny does not increase with more conveyor belts

Connecting a drill to one or multiple squares of conveyor belt: it will
always produce the same amount of resources.
